``npc.html`` randomly generates and displays a 5th edition Dungeons and
Dragons zero-level non player character. 
Download it and launch it in a browser to use it.

Note:
I wrote this to teach myself javascript, and it's highly idomatic (hacky as hell).
I rolled the stylesheet and javascript files into one huge markup file.
This is makes it more difficult to develop and maintain - but I really
wanted this to be one downloadable file to make it super easy to use.
